# Building a Progressive Web App with Next.js 15

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) combine the best of web and native applications. In this tutorial, I'll show you how to implement PWA features in a Next.js 15 application.

## What is a PWA?

A Progressive Web App is a web application that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. Key features include:

- **Offline functionality** via service workers
- **Installability** on devices
- **Push notifications**
- **Fast loading** with caching strategies
- **Responsive design** across all devices

## Setting Up next-pwa

The easiest way to add PWA capabilities to Next.js is using the `next-pwa` library:

```bash
npm install next-pwa
```

Then configure it in your `next.config.ts`:

```typescript
import withPWA from 'next-pwa';

const pwaConfig = {
  dest: 'public',
  register: true,
  skipWaiting: true,
  disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
};

export default withPWA(pwaConfig)(nextConfig);
```

## Creating the Manifest

The web app manifest is a JSON file that tells browsers about your PWA:

```json
{
  "name": "My App",
  "short_name": "App",
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "icons": [...]
}
```

## Service Worker Strategies

Different caching strategies for different content types:

- **NetworkFirst**: Blog posts (fresh content preferred)
- **CacheFirst**: Images and static assets
- **StaleWhileRevalidate**: API responses

## Push Notifications

Implement push notifications using the Web Push API:

```typescript
const subscription = await registration.pushManager.subscribe({
  userVisibleOnly: true,
  applicationServerKey: vapidPublicKey,
});
```

## Offline Experience

Create a beautiful offline fallback page that users see when they're disconnected.

## Testing Your PWA

Use Lighthouse to audit your PWA:

```bash
npm install -g lighthouse
lighthouse https://yoursite.com --view
```

Aim for a PWA score of 90+!

## Conclusion

PWAs offer a powerful way to enhance user experience. With Next.js and next-pwa, implementing these features is straightforward.
